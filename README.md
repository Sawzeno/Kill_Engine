# Kill_Engine

## Description
I just woke up one day and said , imma make god damned game enigne 
PS
i really want to amke gam engine because of just how much of a challege it is  , tough things excite me 

i want to specially focus on rendering and voxels , because i want to make good quality explosions 
currently at infant stage , i myslef am very new to prgramming however as soon as i up my game i will start using 
openvdb library 

one more feature i am relly wanting to laser focus on is to provide some way  for procedural animations
and dynamic animtaions to applied in an easier manner , i want to make the process easy so that one can just apply their math.
